Feature: Feature of Free CRM Login Page 

# In DataTable, we can achieve the passing value without Examples and Scenario Outline
# with few changes in Feature and Step Definition file 
# In Feature File, just type data within the pipe symbol under the particular line, which means that data is applicable to that method alone
# In Step Definition, we have to call DataTable(call raw()) , which return List<List<String> and call by index value
# Output is not readable when compare to examples - Scenario Outline
# we have to create a method for data passed under the each line
